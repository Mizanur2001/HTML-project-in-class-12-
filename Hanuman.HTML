Hanuman Tok is a Hindu temple complex which is located in the upper reaches of Gangtok, the capital of the Indian state of Sikkim. The temple is dedicated to lord Hanuman, the Monkey God,[1] and maintained by the Indian army. Tok means a temple, so it's a temple of Lord Hanuman. But it's actually far more than that and known for its wonderful serene ambience and a viewing area that offers spectacular view of Kanchenjunga range. If you ask me which point in the whole of Gangtok area offers the best views of Kanchenjunga, I won't hesitate to choose Hanuman Tok. It is believed by the locals that Lord Hanuman took rest for a moment at this place when he was on his way to Lanka from the Himalayas. He was carrying sanjeevani herbs to cure Lakshman. The temple is popularly known as wish fulfilling temple.
